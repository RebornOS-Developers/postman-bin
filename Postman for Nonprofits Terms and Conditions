Postman for Nonprofits Terms and Conditions

In addition to the Postman EULA Terms by which I am bound, and as a condition of use of my free Postman accounts, I agree to answer questions from Postman in relation to the Postman for Nonprofits program and participate in any case study that is reasonably requested.

The questions from Postman shall include, but are not limited to, the nature of the organization I work for and how it uses Postman’s services and the Postman for Nonprofits program.

In the event I provide answers or participate in a case study in relation to the Postman for Nonprofits program, I grant Postman a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use and publish the information I provide to Postman, along with my organization’s name and logo.
